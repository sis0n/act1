                                groups found throughout the Philippine archipelago. A majority of mainstream Filipino

                                that compose Filipino cuisine are from the food traditions of various ethnolinguistic

                                Visayan, Chavacano, and Maranao ethnolinguistic groups. The dishes associated with these

                            <p>Japanese cuisine encompasses the regional and traditional foods of Japan, which have
                                developed through centuries of political, economic, and social changes. The traditional
                                cuisine of Japan (Japanese: washoku) is based on rice with miso soup and other dishes;
                                there is an emphasis on seasonal ingredients. Side dishes often consist of fish, pickled
                                vegetables, and vegetables cooked in broth. Seafood is common, often grilled, but also
                                served raw as sashimi or in sushi. Seafood and vegetables are also deep-fried in a light
                                batter, as tempura. Apart from rice, a staple includes noodles, such as soba and udon.
                                Japan also has many simmered dishes, such as fish products in broth called oden, or beef
                                in sukiyaki and nikujaga.</p>
